Create a frame. 

The frame must contain the following components:
	-Panel
	-Choice (2 piece): the first one will contain shapes, the second one will contain colors
	-Checkbox: if the checkbox is checked than fill the shape surface, else draw the shape
	-Button: the program have to fill/draw the shape on the panel when the button is clicked
	-JSlider: the user can change the shape size with this component

The frame and the panel components must be created from two different classes (from two different files).
